# :computer: Welcome to my Github!

---

I'm Colacky! I'm a software developer!

I use Java, Python and many other languages, depending on the task at hand.
I'm very versatile and I grasp things quickly - that includes programs/languages that are very niche/industry specific (that means no StackOverflow for me).

I'm also very tenacious when it comes to debugging things and don't give up easily.

Since I started working as a developer full-time I didn't have as much time for personal projects, so my github went kind of stale.

## Projects:
1. Mars Rover Picture Retriever - a desktop app written in Java using JavaFX that uses NASA Api to deliver pictures from Mars rovers, based on user choices (ie. rover, camera, date)
2. Spacerniak [PL]
  A project demo just launched at https://spacerniak.herokuapp.com (will be taken down once heroku cuts free deployment)
  It's a django web-app that I've built for a local shelter I'm volunteering at - it allows us to keep track of how many walks a dog gets, it also suggests to take 10  least-walked dogs in form of a card carousel. Each volunteer can keep track of how many walks in total they've had. This can be considered an MVP.
  To test it you can use these credentials:
  1. Login: Wolontariusz0
  2. Pass: Testkonto1

## Some of my software:
1. Watermarker - a simple desktop python program that can be used to watermark pictures in bulk, absolutely free of charge. It can be found on my website https://colacky.github.io
2. WeakestLink - a desktop python app that can aid in finding the best target in World of Warcraft battlegrounds/arenas.
