# :computer: Welcome to my Github!

I'm Colacky! I've started dipping my toes into software development slowly over past 3 years.

I'm about to launch my first web-app soon. :watch:

## Some of my software:
1. Watermarker - a simple desktop python program that can be used to watermark pictures in bulk, absolutely free of charge. It can be found on my website https://colacky.github.io
2. WeakestLink - a desktop python app that can aid in finding the best target in World of Warcraft battlegrounds/arenas.

# SKILLS

## Front-end
While front-end isn't my cup of tea, as I'm artistically-impaired, I have learned the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript to allow me to show my other works to the community :)
I'm familiar with using Bootstrap.

## Back-end
I enjoy using Python to build up my ideas into reality quickly. I'm getting better at Django, so that my ideas can be brought to a broader audience.

## Other
I also learn anything I find is necessary to complete a project - it's almost like this software development thing is a constant, never-ending learning process, huh? :smiley:
In my past two employments, I have been given team leading/coordinating positions within 2 years - I guess that means I can handle stuff.
